# Week 1 Challenge: HTML, CSS, and Git Code Refactor

## Description

This repo contains a webpage that was given to me to 'tidy up.' The page is for a company that specializes in search engine optimization. My goal was to make the website more accessible, refactor the CSS sheet, and change the HTML semantics to be more precise. I was given an HTML and CSS sheet, and used VSC to make any changes, as well as gitbash to push and commit. The follwoing screenshot shows the final page.
